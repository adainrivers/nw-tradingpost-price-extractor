# Screenshot Parser
Easy to use TP screenshot parser.

## How to build
- Install .NET 5.0 SDK (Windows x64) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0
- Run publish.cmd, which will create Parser.exe in Publish folder.

If you don't wanna deal with that, just download the binary release from: [Latest Release](https://github.com/adainrivers/nw-tradingpost-price-extractor/releases/tag/0.1.9)

## How it works

Take screenshots of TP in regular way. Then launch the tool and open screenshot files. 

## Use with caution

NW TOS is very restrictive, even with extracting information from screenshots, so, use it on your own risk.
